# Colour-Pciker

##Introduction

As a part of my training in JavaScript to improve mi skills, I decide to rite code everyday and publish it on GitHub.

Today I am uploading a Colour-Picker. It is a simple and responsive Colour-Picker

## Goals

- Create an slider Colour-Picker.
- Improve my programming skills using CSS, HTML and JavaScript in the application.
- Build an application that I can reuse in my next projects.

## Approach

Using plain Vanilla JS and jQuery I have created a colour picker. Any time you move the mouse on top od the square the values of 'red' and 'green' will change and you can use the range to change the value of the 'blue'.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS.
- JavaScript
- jQuery.
